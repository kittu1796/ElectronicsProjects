		\subsection{Introduction}

%This paragraph contains the overview of the project.
			\lettrine{T}{he} Remote Display utilises a simple static scrolling \gls{led} display and makes it accessible from a nearby location using the \gls{ble} feature of an Android phone. Using such a feature the user can modify the display at will and with ease, this reduces the time to manually reprogram the controlling unit and does not require any computer. Having remote access makes the display very handy for a users who keeps the display at a non accessible location. 
			
		\subsection{Feature and Functionality}
%This section contains how the project will function and what are its features
		The Remote Display has following  features and functionality.

		\subsection{Hardware}
			\subsubsection{MCU}
				The remote display is built around a ATmega328P \gls{avr} microcontroller. This \gls{mcu} is based on advanced \gls{risc} \cite{AtMega328P} architecture, 8 bit \gls{mcu} and 23 programmable \gls{io} lines. For controlling the \textsc{remote display} shift registers are used, 2 for Column and 1 for row, due to shift registers few \gls{mcu} \gls{io} lines are used.
			\subsubsection{LED Matrix}
				 Single colour  red 5mm \gls{led} used to build the matrix, total of 128 \gls{led} required for 16x8 matrix. An array of transistors configured as switch to provide required current for each row of \gls{led} matrix.  

			\subsubsection{Power supply}
				The project utilises a transformerless capacitive power supply design. Such a design is helpful in reducing the overall cost of project and also utilises fewer components thus saving space and cost.			
			
			\subsubsection{Input}
				 The project is aimed to dynamically modify the display commands through an input source like computer or \gls{ble}, through \gls{usart}. Such a feature helps in modifying the display at will rather than modifying the source code.
