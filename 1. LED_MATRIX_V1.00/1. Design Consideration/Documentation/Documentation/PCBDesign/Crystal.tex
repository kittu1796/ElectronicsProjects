\subsection{Crystal}
	Following are the precautions taken while designing layout for crystal oscillator circuit.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Crystal placed at very short distance from \gls{mcu} to avoid stray capacitance.
		\item Shielding crystal with ground plane
		\item Crystal tracks to be apart from each other, minimize stray capacitance.
		\item Keep clock and high frequency lines far away form crystal.
		\item Load $XTAL_{in}$ capacitor should be closer to $XTAL_{in}$ pin and ground plane.(cite application note.)
	\end{enumerate}
