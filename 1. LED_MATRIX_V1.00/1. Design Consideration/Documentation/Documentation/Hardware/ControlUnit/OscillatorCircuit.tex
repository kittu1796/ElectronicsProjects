%first create all the reference in bibfile.

	\paragraph{The} oscillator circuit is required for generating clock for \gls{mcu}.Accuracy of timing application is dependent on the accuracy of the oscillator provided in the \gls{mcu}. The oscillators supported by ATmega328P are listed below.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Low power crystal oscillator
			\item Full swing crystal oscillator
			\item Low frequency crystal oscillator
			\item Internal 128kHz RC oscillator
			\item Calibrated internal RC oscillator
			\item External clock
		\end{itemize}		
		
	\paragraph{Selecting} crystal requires following considerations.
		\begin{enumerate}
				\item \gls{tht} or \gls{smt}.
				\item Load capacitance.
				\item Frequency of operation
				\item Q - factor
				\item \gls{esr}
				\item Frequency Pulling
				\item Drive level
				\item Minimum negative Resistance
				\item Frequency stability
				\item Frequency Tolerance
		\end{enumerate}
